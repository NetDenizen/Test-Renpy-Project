# Test Ren'Py Project

THIS PROJECT IS NOW ARCHIVED. Not doing anything more with it, for the time being.

This project is both to experiment and familiarize myself Ren'Py, and to provide others examples of a small project, utilizing different features of the engine, and uploaded to GitHub.

So far, it demonstrates:

* Basic flow control in the form of labels, calls, and jumps.

* Transitions.

* Mixing of Ren'Py and pure Python code.

* String interpolation and formatting.

* Menus

* Text input

* Styles

* Transform

* Screens

* Imagemaps

* Buttons

* The custom 'ButtonMask' implementation

* Sound effects

More to come, later. Please let me know if you have any questions or feedback.
